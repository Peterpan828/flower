# DepthFL: Depthwise Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Clients

> Note: If you use this baseline in your work, please remember to cite the original authors of the paper as well as the Flower paper.

****Paper:**** : https://openreview.net/forum?id=pf8RIZTMU58

****Authors:**** : Minjae Kim, Sangyoon Yu, Suhyun Kim, Soo-Mook Moon

****Abstract:**** : Federated learning is for training a global model without collecting private local data from clients. As they repeatedly need to upload locally-updated weights or gradients instead, clients require both computation and communication resources enough to participate in learning, but in reality their resources are heterogeneous. To enable resource-constrained clients to train smaller local models, width scaling techniques have been used, which reduces the channels of a global model. Unfortunately, width scaling suffers from heterogeneity of local models when averaging them, leading to a lower accuracy than when simply excluding resource-constrained clients from training. This paper proposes a new approach based on depth scaling called DepthFL. DepthFL defines local models of different depths by pruning the deepest layers off the global model, and allocates them to clients depending on their available resources. Since many clients do not have enough resources to train deep local models, this would make deep layers partially-trained with insufficient data, unlike shallow layers that are fully trained. DepthFL alleviates this problem by mutual self-distillation of knowledge among the classifiers of various depths within a local model. Our experiments show that depth-scaled local models build a global model better than width-scaled ones, and that self-distillation is highly effective in training data-insufficient deep layers.


## About this baseline

****Whatâ€™s implemented:**** : The code in this directory replicates the experiments in DepthFL: Depthwise Federated Learning for Heterogeneous Clients (Kim et al., 2023) for CIFAR100, which proposed the DepthFL algorithm. Concretely, it replicates the results for CIFAR100 in Table 2,3 and 4.

****Datasets:**** : CIFAR100 from PyTorch's Torchvision

****Hardware Setup:**** : These experiments were run on a server with Nvidia 3090 GPUs. Any machine with 1x 8GB GPU or more would be able to run it in a reasonable amount of time. 

****Contributors:**** : Minjae Kim


## Experimental Setup

****Task:**** : Image Classification

****Model:**** : ResNet18 with additional bottleneck layers

**Dataset:** This baseline only includes the CIFAR100 dataset. By default it will be partitioned into 100 clients following IID distribution. The settings are as follow:

| Dataset | #classes | #partitions | partitioning method |
| :------ | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| CIFAR100 | 100 | 100 | IID |

**Training Hyperparameters:**
The following table shows the main hyperparameters for this baseline with their default value (i.e. the value used if you run `python main.py` directly)

| Description | Default Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| total clients | 1000 |
| clients per round | 10 |
| number of rounds | 100 |
| client resources | {'num_cpus': 2.0, 'num_gpus': 0.0 }|
| data partition | pathological with power law (2 classes per client) |
| optimizer | SGD with proximal term |
| proximal mu | 1.0 |
| stragglers_fraction | 0.9 |


## Environment Setup

:warning: _The Python environment for all baselines should follow these guidelines in the `EXTENDED_README`. Specify the steps to create and activate your environment. If there are any external system-wide requirements, please include instructions for them too. These instructions should be comprehensive enough so anyone can run them (if non standard, describe them step-by-step)._


## Running the Experiments

:warning: _Provide instructions on the steps to follow to run all the experiments._
```bash  
# The main experiment implemented in your baseline using default hyperparameters (that should be setup in the Hydra configs) should run (including dataset download and necessary partitioning) by executing the command:

poetry run -m <baseline-name>.main <no additional arguments> # where <baseline-name> is the name of this directory and that of the only sub-directory in this directory (i.e. where all your source code is)

# If you are using a dataset that requires a complicated download (i.e. not using one natively supported by TF/PyTorch) + preprocessing logic, you might want to tell people to run one script first that will do all that. Please ensure the download + preprocessing can be configured to suit (at least!) a different download directory (and use as default the current directory). The expected command to run to do this is:

poetry run -m <baseline-name>.dataset_preparation <optional arguments, but default should always run>

# It is expected that you baseline supports more than one dataset and different FL settings (e.g. different number of clients, dataset partitioning methods, etc). Please provide a list of commands showing how these experiments are run. Include also a short explanation of what each one does. Here it is expected you'll be using the Hydra syntax to override the default config.

poetry run -m <baseline-name>.main  <override_some_hyperparameters>
.
.
.
poetry run -m <baseline-name>.main  <override_some_hyperparameters>
```


## Expected Results

:warning: _Your baseline implementation should replicate several of the experiments in the original paper. Please include here the exact command(s) needed to run each of those experiments followed by a figure (e.g. a line plot) or table showing the results you obtained when you ran the code. Below is an example of how you can present this. Please add command followed by results for all your experiments._

```bash
# it is likely that for one experiment you need to sweep over different hyperparameters. You are encouraged to use Hydra's multirun functionality for this. This is an example of how you could achieve this for some typical FL hyperparameteres

poetry run -m <baseline-name>.main --multirun num_client_per_round=5,10,50 dataset=femnist,cifar10
# the above command will run a total of 6 individual experiments (because 3client_configs x 2datasets = 6 -- you can think of it as a grid).

[Now show a figure/table displaying the results of the above command]

# add more commands + plots for additional experiments.
```
